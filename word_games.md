  ## Part 1

Write a command-line program that asks the user to unscramble a 5-letter word.

When the user runs the program (`./word_games`), a scrambled 5-letter word is shown to them. The program then awaits their answer.

If correct, the program acknowledges that and exits.

If incorrect, it shows the correct word and exits.
